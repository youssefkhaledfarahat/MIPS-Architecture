MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) is a reduced instruction set computer
(RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA).
Reduced instruction set computer (RISC) is a computer instruction set that allows the microprocessor to have fewer cycles per instruction (CPI) than a complex instruction set computer (CISC)
by having simple and general instructions. In CISC, we have complex instructions which take many clock
cycles to get executed compared to RISC.
The MIPS32 instruction set is an instruction set standard published in 1999. Currently, the MIP32
instruction set is the most common MIPS instruction set, compatible with most CPUs. Due to its relative simplicity, it is also the most common instruction set taught in computer architecture university
courses.
In this project, you will implement a simplified version of the MIPS32 Architecture using Java as
a programming language.
